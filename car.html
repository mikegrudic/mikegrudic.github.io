    <p>
        Welcome! This is my 2019 Volkswagen GTI Rabbit Edition. Arguably the greatest
        incarnation of the Golf, Volkswagen's all-time best selling model, this car just does it all. It's fun to drive
        but
        emminently practical for any lifestyle.</p>

    <p>
        I love this car and have taken very good care of it, but I will not be needing a car anymore and hope that you
        can enjoy it.
    </p>

    A fair price for this car would be <b>$21,000</b>. Please visit the <a href="https://flic.kr/s/aHBqjByRBN">photo
        and video
        album</a> for a good look. To inquire or arrange a viewing please contact me at <b>buy.mikes.gti at gmail dot

    <h2>The Basics</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Color</b>: Urano Grey</li>
        <li><b>Trim Level</b>: Rabbit Edition</li>
        <li><b>VIN</b>: 3VW6T7AU7KM004331</li>
        <li><b>Odometer reading (6/28/2024)</b>: 60761 miles</li>
        <li><b>Engine:</b> EA888 2.0L turbocharged engine making 228 hp @ 4700 rpm and 258 lb-ft @ 1500 rpm (with tuning
            options for much more)
        </li>
        <li><b>Transmission:</b> 7-speed DSG automatic with paddle and Tiptronic shifting</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>This Model</h2>
    Among modern GTIs, this particular model has numerous advantages. The Rabbit Edition was produced only for the 2019
    model year
    and this example is in the unique, head-turning Urano Grey color. Park of the Mk 7.5 generation, it gets the best of
    the differential, brake, and power upgrades of the Mk 7-7.5 GTIs. And the Mk7.5 generation came out after various
    teething issues in the earlier Mk7s were worked out -- its powertrain is generally agreed to be more reliable than
    the previous generations of gas-direct-injection turbo VW/Audi vehicles, and that has certainly been true for this
    example so far.
    <p>
        The Rabbit Edition trim sits between the S and SE in terms of equipment, having an upgraded lighting package and
        spoiler over the S, retaining the iconic Clark Plaid seats not found on the higher trims, and avoiding VW's
        notoriously-leaky sunroofs also found in the higher trims. It is modern enough to have a touchscreen with Apple
        CarPlay and Android Auto, but comes before the Mk 8 generation's poorly-received interior user interface.
    <p>
        If you've been wanting to get into a modern GTI, this is the one.

    <h2>History</h2>
    I first purchased this car new in February 2019 in Cerritos, CA. Subsequently, the car was owned in the following
    locations:
    <ul>
        <li>Pasadena, CA: Feb 2019-Aug 2019</li>
        <li>Evanston, IL: Sept 2019-Aug 2021</li>
        <li>Pasadena, CA: Sept 2021-present</li>
    </ul>
    The period based in IL still had significant stints in CA, as evidenced by the service history below.

    It is easy to see that the car is in very good condition for its mileage, for several reasons:
    <ul>
        <li>It has never been used as a daily commuter vehicle.</li>
        <li>It has never been in an accident.</li>
        <li>It has spent most of its life in Southern California.</li>
        <li>Its daily parking situation has always been either indoors or covered.</li>
        <li>This car has been extensively used for roadtrips, so many of its miles are highway miles, which incur less
            wear per mile.</li>
    </ul>

    In the past the car has been run on Stage 1 ECU and TCU tunes from EQT and Stratified. It has been flashed back to
    its factory ECU and TCU software and passes all tests in an official California smog test.

    <h2>Modifications and Accessories</h2>

    </ul>

    <h2>Mechanical Condition</h2>
    This car has not had a single mechanical problem. It still runs
    very smoothly and efficiently. Its oil consumption is very low: I check the oil level routinely and have never
    had to top it up.


    <h2>Cosmetic Flaws</h2>
    There are a few points of cosmetic wear to be aware of.
    <ul>
        <li>The passenger side interior B-pillar trim piece is scuffed.</li>
        <li>One wheel has curb rash.</li>
        <li>The windshield has 2 ~quarter-sized chips near the bottom that have been professionally repaired to the
            extent possible.
        </li>
        <li>The hood has some small rock chips.</li>
        <li>Some scratches on the read bumper.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Tools and Accessories Included</h2>
    The car comes with various useful special tools that I will not need anymore.
    <ul>
        <li>OEM VW coil pack pulling tool</li>
        <li>Magnetic spark plug socket</li>
        <li>Oil filter socket</li>
        <li>Hose clamp pliers</li>
        <li>Wheel hanger tool</li>
        <li>Magnetic tray</li>
        <li>Noco Genius battery charger/maintainer</li>
    </ul>

    This is in addition to the original equipment that came with the car:

    <ul>
        <li>Spare tire with jack and wrench</li>
        <li>Genuine VW Roadside Assistance Kit</li>
    </ul>
