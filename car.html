    Welcome! I'm Mike and I would like to sell you my 2019 Volkswagen GTI Rabbit Edition. Arguably the I love it and
    have
    taken very good care of it, but I will not be needing a car anymore and hope that somebody else can enjoy it as much
    as I have. I am asking <b>$21,000</b> for this car. Please visit the <a href="https://flic.kr/s/aHBqjByRBN">photo
        and video
        album</a> for a good look. For inquiries please email me at <b>mike.grudic at gmail dot com</b>

    <h2>The Basics</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Color</b>: Urano Grey</li>
        <li><b>Trim Level</b>: Rabbit Edition</li>
        <li><b>VIN</b>: 3VW6T7AU7KM004331</li>
        <li><b>Odometer reading (6/28/2024)</b>: 60761 miles</li>
        <li><b>Engine:</b> EA888 2.0L turbocharged engine making 228 hp @ 4700 rpm and 258 lb-ft @ 1500 rpm (with tuning
            options for much more)
        </li>
        <li><b>Transmission:</b> 7-speed DSG automatic with paddle and Tiptronic shifting</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>History</h2>
    I first purchased this car new in February 2019 in Cerritos, CA. Subsequently, the car was owned in the following
    locations:
    <ul>
        <li>Pasadena, CA: Feb 2019-Aug 2019</li>
        <li>Evanston, IL: Sept 2019-Aug 2021</li>
        <li>Pasadena, CA: Sept 2021-present</li>
    </ul>

    It is easy to see that the car is in very good condition for its mileage, for several reasons:
    <ul>
        <li>It has never been used as a daily commuter vehicle.</li>
        <li>It has spent most of its life in Southern California.</li>
        <li>Its daily parking situation has always been either indoors or covered.</li>
        <li>This car has been extensively used for roadtrips, so many of its miles are highway miles, which incur less
            wear per mile.</li>
    </ul>

    In the past the car has been run on Stage 1 ECU and TCU tunes from EQT and Stratified. It has been flashed back to
    its factory ECU and TCU software and passes all tests in an official California smog test.

    <h2>Modifications and Accessories</h2>
    This vehicle has been lightly modified for driving enjoyment.
    <ul>
        <li>Tint: F1 Pinnacle 40% on the sides and rear, F1 Stratos 15% visor strip across the windshield.</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Mechanical Condition</h2>
    This car has not had a single problem in the operation of the drivetrain during its life. It still runs
    very smoothly and efficiently. Its oil consumption is very low: I check the oil level routinely and have never
    had to top it up.


    <h2>Cosmetic Flaws</h2>
    The car has 4 salient points of cosmetic wear that I am aware of.
    <ul>
        <li>The passenger side B-pillar trim piece is scuffed.</li>
        <li>One wheel has curb rash.</li>
        <li>The windshield has 2 ~quarter-sized chips that have been professionally repaired to the extent possible.
        </li>
        <li>The hood has some small rock chips.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Tools and Accessories Included</h2>
    The car comes with various useful special tools that I will not need anymore.
    <ul>
        <li>OEM VW spark plug pulling tool</li>
        <li>Magnetic spark plug socket</li>
        <li>Ratch oil filter adapter</li>
        <li>Hose clamp pliers</li>
        <li>Wheel hanger tool</li>
        <li>Magnetic tray</li>
    </ul>

    This is in addition to the original equipment that came with the car:

    <ul>
        <li>Spare tire with jack and wrenchf</li>
        <li>Genuine VW Roadside Assistance Kit</li>
    </ul>
